# Deploying DPR Insight to Cloudflare Pages

This guide walks through hosting the DPR Insight Next.js app on Cloudflare Pages so you can share it on a `*.pages.dev` (or custom) domain.

## 1. Prerequisites

- Cloudflare account with Pages access.
- NVIDIA API key (required) and optional Tavily API key.
- Node.js 18+ locally for building before deployment.
- GitHub (or GitLab/Bitbucket) repository, or the ability to deploy via `wrangler` CLI.

## 2. Configure Environment Variables

In Cloudflare Pages, open **Settings â†’ Environment Variables** for your project and add:

| Variable | Required | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `NVIDIA_API_KEY` | âœ… | Paste the same key you use locally. |
| `OPENAI_API_KEY` | âœ… | Required during the OpenNext build step for the NVIDIA SDK shim. |
| `CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN` | âœ… | Needed when the build command runs `wrangler pages deploy` inside Cloudflareâ€™s builder. Grant **Cloudflare Pages:Edit** and **Workers Scripts:Read** at the account scope. |
| `TAVILY_API_KEY` | Optional | Needed only if you turned on Tavily search. |

> ðŸ’¡ If you connect via Git, you can set these before the first build. When using the CLI deploy flow you can pass them with `--env` or set them in the dashboard afterwards.

## 3. Recommended Flow â€“ Git-Connected Deployment

This is the easiest long-term setup: every push to `main` (and pull requests) will trigger a Page build on Cloudflareâ€™s Linux workers, avoiding Windows bundling issues.

1. **Push to Git** â€“ commit your work and push to GitHub/GitLab/Bitbucket. Make sure `.open-next/` and other build folders are ignored (already handled in `.gitignore`).
2. **Connect Cloudflare Pages** â€“ in the dashboard choose **Create a project â†’ Connect to Git** and pick your repo/branch (`main`).
3. **Build settings**:
   - Framework preset: **None** (we let OpenNext craft the worker and assets).
   - Build command: `npm run cf-deploy` (runs the OpenNext build and deploys via Wrangler in one shot).
   - Deploy command: leave blank/disabledâ€”the deploy happens inside the build command.
   - Build output directory: leave empty; Wrangler uploads directly from `.open-next`.
4. **Environment variables** â€“ set `NVIDIA_API_KEY` (and optional `TAVILY_API_KEY`) before the first build so the app can reach NVIDIA during SSR.
5. **Kick off the build** â€“ hit save. Cloudflare compiles the project and deploys a production site. Every subsequent push repeats the flow; PRs get preview URLs automatically.

> `npm run cf-deploy` invokes `open-next build` under the hood. If you need to inspect the bundle separately, run `npm run cf-build` locally to populate `.open-next`.

### Required Cloudflare API token

Because the build command calls `wrangler pages deploy`, the Pages builder must have an API token with the right scopes. Create one from **Profile â†’ API Tokens â†’ Create** using the *Edit Cloudflare Pages* template (or manually grant **Account.Cloudflare Pages â†’ Edit** plus **Account.Workers Scripts â†’ Read**). Add the token value to the projectâ€™s environment variables as `CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN` for both Production and Preview environments.

## 4. Option B â€“ Manual Deploy with Wrangler

If you prefer manual deploys or want to test before pushing to Git:

```bash
npm install
npm run cf-deploy -- --project-name dpr-insight
```

- `npm run cf-deploy` runs the OpenNext build and uploads the bundle to Pages; pass `--project-name` the first time (or hardcode it in the script). `npm run cf:deploy` remains as a local alias if you prefer the colon style.
- The command expects `CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN` to be present in your shell. When running locally you can export it or use `wrangler login` instead of the token.

## 5. Custom Domain (Optional)

1. After a successful deploy you get a `https://<project>.pages.dev` URL.
2. To use your own domain, go to **Custom Domains** in the Pages project.
3. Add the domain or subdomain, then follow Cloudflareâ€™s DNS instructions.

## 6. Notes & Troubleshooting

- **SSR streaming & Edge runtime**: Cloudflare Pages runs on the Edge runtime, which the NVIDIA API client supports. Ensure your environment keys are valid.
- **Cache busting**: The streaming API route (`/api/analyze`) runs using Edge runtime and works without extra config.
- **CI/CD**: Cloudflare Pages automatically builds on each push. You can restrict production deploys to specific branches in project settings.

Once deployed, your app is accessible via the Cloudflare Pages URLâ€”perfect for sharing live demos of the council experience.
