Project: East-West Industrial Corridor Freight Rail Link (Silchar → Dimapur)
Project Code: EWFC-SD-001
Date: October 15, 2025
Status: STRATEGIC PROPOSAL
1. Executive Overview
This report outlines a proposal for a ₹4,800 Crore, 380 km dedicated freight corridor to connect key economic centers in Assam,
Nagaland, and Manipur. The project is of paramount strategic importance for India's "Act East" policy, aiming to integrate the
Northeast's economy with the mainland and Southeast Asia. The base-case Economic Internal Rate of Return (EIRR) is calculated at
14.2%. However, the project's viability is challenged by a gauntlet of severe, interlocking risks that a conventional assessment would
underestimate. The stated budget of ₹4,800 Crore is considered critically insufficient given the extreme geological,
environmental, and security challenges. The project's execution requires a fundamentally different approach, moving beyond
standard project management to a dedicated, high-authority task force. Failure to address any single one of the identified critical
risks will lead to cascading delays, massive cost overruns, and potential project failure.
2. Core Project & Risk Metrics
Metric Value / Status Implication
Total Capital Outlay ₹4,800 Crore Highly Optimistic. Inadequate for mountainous terrain, 22
tunnels, and security overheads.
Route Length 380 km New Broad-Gauge Crosses 13 districts across Assam, Nagaland, Manipur,
requiring complex tripartite coordination.
Engineering 22 Tunnels, 180 Bridges Extreme geological and seismic risks inherent to the region.
High construction & maintenance costs.
Land Acquisition 2,340 Hectares A massive undertaking with severe complications.
↳ Forest Land 1,404 ha (60%) Triggers stringent Forest Conservation Act; requires MoEFCC
clearance and costly compensatory afforestation.
↳ Schedule-VI Land 187 ha (8%) Requires consent from Autonomous Councils; high risk of
social/political opposition and delay.
Security Threat 76 km in AFSPA Zone High risk of insurgency, extortion, and attacks on
assets/personnel. Requires significant security budget.
Climate Threat +11% extreme rain days Increased probability of landslides & flash floods threatens
structural integrity and operational uptime.
3. Critical Risk Domain Analysis
A. Land & Environmental: The project's primary hurdle is land. Acquiring 1,404 hectares of forest land will be a protracted,
multi-year process with an uncertain outcome. Simultaneously, securing 187 hectares of 6th Schedule tribal land presents a
severe socio-political challenge that, if handled poorly, could ignite local opposition and halt the project indefinitely. These two
factors alone make the proposed timeline and budget untenable.
B. Security & Geopolitical: The passage of a 76 km segment through a "disturbed area" under AFSPA cannot be overstated.
This is not a standard law-and-order issue; it is a high-threat security environment. The project will face persistent risks from
insurgent groups, requiring a dedicated security infrastructure, intelligence apparatus, and rapid-response capability, adding
substantial and recurring operational costs not factored into a standard EIRR.
C. Engineering & Climate Resilience: The construction of 22 tunnels and 180 bridges in a seismically active and geologically
young mountain range is a monumental engineering challenge. Standard designs are insufficient. Furthermore, the climate
projection of an 11% increase in extreme rainfall makes landslides and flash floods a near certainty. The engineering design must
incorporate advanced climate resilience measures, and the operational plan must account for frequent weather-related disruptions.
The current budget likely fails to price in these non-negotiable requirements.`,

Plant, Tinsukia, Assam
Project Code: GTP-TSK-001
Date: October 15, 2025
Status: PRELIMINARY ASSESSMENT - HIGH RISK
1. Executive Overview
This document outlines a proposal for a ₹120 Crore (1200 Mn INR) greenfield tea extraction and PET bottling facility in
Tinsukia, Assam. The project targets an annual capacity of 1.2 lakh Metric Tonnes and projects the creation of 850
direct and 2,100 indirect jobs.
While the economic rationale is strong, the project's viability is severely compromised by four critical risk vectors: (1)
Environmental & Regulatory, (2) Social & Legal, (3) Geotechnical, and (4) Logistical. The current site selection
presents multiple project-halting impediments. Proceeding without a comprehensive, fully-funded mitigation plan for
these issues is inadvisable. The project's Environmental Clearance (EC) is far from guaranteed.
2. Key Project Metrics
Metric Value
Capital Outlay ₹120 Crore (1200 Mn INR)
Production Capacity 120,000 Metric Tonnes / Year
Land Requirement 35 Acres
Direct Employment 850 Personnel
Indirect Employment 2,100 Personnel
Regulatory Status Form-I submitted to MoEFCC; EIA pending
3. Site & Infrastructure Analysis
● Water Source: Raw water abstraction is planned from a Brahmaputra tributary located at the edge of the
Dibru-Saikhowa National Park's eco-sensitive zone. This poses a major risk for securing environmental clearance.
● Connectivity: The site is 17 km from NH-15. The final 6 km is a single-lane PCC road, which is critically inadequate
for heavy vehicle movement required for construction and operations. This represents a significant logistical
bottleneck.
● Geotechnical Profile: The location falls within Seismic Zone V, India's highest-risk earthquake zone, with a Peak
Ground Acceleration (PGA) of 0.36g. Standard construction designs are insufficient and will require significant, costly
engineering modifications.
4. Land Acquisition Profile
The 35-acre parcel presents profound legal and social challenges:
● 6th Schedule Tribal Land: 28% (9.8 acres) of the site is designated tribal land, requiring consent from the
Autonomous District Council. This is a complex and politically sensitive process with a high risk of failure or delay.
● Wetland Paddy: 4% (1.4 acres) of the site is classified as wetland, the conversion of which is heavily restricted and
will face opposition.`,
